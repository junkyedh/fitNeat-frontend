# fitNeat Frontend

**fitNeat** is a user interface (UI) project developed for the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course. This project focuses solely on building an interactive, modern, and responsive frontend for a fitness-related application. No backend or business logic is implemented—this is a UI/UX design and prototyping project.

## Project Overview

- **Course:** Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate UI/UX design skills for a fitness management/discovery app
- **Scope:** UI only (no backend, no real data)

## Features

- **Landing Page:** Introduction and quick access to main features
- **Explore Gyms & Classes:** Browse a list of fitness centers, classes, and activities
- **Booking Flow (UI only):** Simulate booking a class or gym session
- **User Profile Screens:** View and edit mock user information, preferences, and activity history
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI Elements:** Engaging visuals, smooth navigation, and clear information hierarchy

## Tech Stack
